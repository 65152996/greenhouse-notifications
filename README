This Node application publishes notifications to the main Greenhouse web application.  It receives messages from a Redis pub/sub topic and then pushes them out to subscribed browser clients via the Socket.IO Node module.

The app can be started locally (assuming you have NodeJS set up correctly) by executing 'node app.js' from the root directory of the project.

When running in local mode, it is expected that there is also already a local Redis instance running (on localhost using the default Redis port).

When running on Cloud Foundry, it is expected that the app has a Redis service bound to it.

The app will auto-detect its environment on startup, configuring the correct Redis connection based on what is detected.

Socket.IO is currently configured to only use the Comet long-polling technique, as Cloud Foundry does not currently allow WebSocket traffic.
